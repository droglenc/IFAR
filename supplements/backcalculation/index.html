<p><span class="citation">Francis (1990)</span> defined <em>back-calculation</em> as “<em>… a technique that uses a set of measurements made on a fish at one time to infer its length at an earlier time or times. Specifically, the dimensions of one or more marks in some hard part of the fish, together with its current body length, are used to estimate its length at the time of formation of each of the marks. … The marks are generally annual rings associated with growth checks, … .</em>” Thus, backcalculation is the reconstruction of the length of a fish at previous ages from measurements made on calcified structures.</p>

<h2>Terminology</h2>
<p>Two types of measurements can be made on calcified structures. A <em>radial</em> measurement is the total distance from the center of the structure (e.g., focus of scale or nucleus of otolith) to the edge of an annulus. An <em>incremental</em> measurement is the distance between two successive annuli. Radial measurements are required for back-calculation of fish length.</p>
<p>Back-calculation models estimate length at previous age <span class="math">\(i\)</span> (i.e., <span class="math">\(L_{i}\)</span>) from known values of length at time of capture (<span class="math">\(L_{C}\)</span>), scale radius to the <span class="math">\(i\)</span>th annulus (<span class="math">\(S_{i}\)</span>), and scale radius at time of capture (<span class="math">\(S_{C}\)</span>). Several back-calculation models rely on the relationship between <span class="math">\(S_{C}\)</span> and <span class="math">\(L_{C}\)</span>. Depending on the model, a function of mean <span class="math">\(S_{C}\)</span> for a given <span class="math">\(L_{C}\)</span> (i.e., <span class="math">\(E(S_{C}|L_{C})\)</span> ) or mean <span class="math">\(L_{C}\)</span> for a given <span class="math">\(S_{C}\)</span> (i.e., <span class="math">\(E(L_{C}|S_{C})\)</span>) is used. These functions are not required to be linear, but often are, and in their linear form are represented as</p>
<p><span class="math">\[ E(S_{C}|L_{C})=a+bL_{C} \quad \quad \text{(1)} \]</span></p>
<p><span class="math">\[ E(L_{C}|S_{C})=c+dS_{C} \quad \quad \text{(2)} \]</span></p>

<h2>Common Back-Calculation Models</h2>
<p>The first back-calculation model was jointly developed by Knut Dahl and Einar Lea and appeared in <span class="citation">Lea (1910)</span>. The underlying concept of the <em>Dahl-Lea model</em> is that growth of the calcified structure is in exact proportion to growth in length of the fish. With this, the ratio of <span class="math">\(S_{i}\)</span> to <span class="math">\(S_{C}\)</span> is the same as the ratio of <span class="math">\(L_{i}\)</span> to <span class="math">\(L_{C}\)</span>. Rearrangement of this equality yields the Dahl-Lea back-calculation model</p>
<p><span class="math">\[ L_{i}=\frac{S_{i}}{S_{C}}L_{C} \quad \quad \text{(3)} \]</span></p>
<p>The Dahl-Lea model describes a family of straight lines that pass through the <strong>origin</strong> and each observed (<span class="math">\(S_{C},L_{C}\)</span>) point. Visually (Figure 1), the estimated <span class="math">\(L_{i}\)</span> for a particular fish is found by locating <span class="math">\(S_{i}\)</span> along the x-axis, moving vertically until the straight line for that fish is met, and then moving horizontally to the point on the y-axis.</p>

<p>Figure 1: Plot of length-at-capture versus scale radius for West Bearskin Lake Smallmouth Bass in 1990. All four methods of backcalculation are shown for fish 704 (<span class="math">\(S_{2}=3.49804\)</span>, <span class="math">\(L_{C}=218\)</span>, and <span class="math">\(S_{C}=7.44389\)</span>; black point and line) with calculational steps shown with the arrows. Fish 701 is shown as the gray point and line for comparative purposes.</p>
<p><span class="citation">Fraser (1916)</span> was the first to describe, but <span class="citation">Lee (1920)</span> was the first to formally derive, the back-calculation model from the concept that “the growth <em>increment</em> of the scale is, on the average …, a constant proportion of the growth <em>increment</em> of the fish” <span class="citation">(Francis 1990)</span>. In practice, the <em>Fraser-Lee model</em> modified the Dahl-Lea model by adjusting for the length of the fish when the calcified structure forms (i.e., <span class="math">\(L=c\)</span> when <span class="math">\(S=0\)</span>), that is,</p>
<p><span class="math">\[ L_{i}=\frac{S_{i}}{S_{C}}(L_{C}-c)+c \quad \quad \text{(4)} \]</span></p>
<p>where <span class="math">\(c\)</span> comes from the length of the fish at the time of scale formation, the intercept of the length-scale relationship regression (e.g., from Equation 2), or from published “standards” for a species <span class="citation">(Carlander 1982)</span>. The Fraser-Lee model describes a family of lines with an intercept of <span class="math">\(c\)</span> that pass through the (<span class="math">\(S_{C},L_{C}\)</span>) point (<span class="citation">Francis (1990)</span>; Figure 1).</p>
<p>The <em>scale proportional hypothesis</em> (SPH) model was named by <span class="citation">Francis (1990)</span>, but was first recognized by <span class="citation">Whitney and Carlander (1956)</span> when they said “<em>{i}f the scale was 10 per cent larger when the fish was caught than the average scale for that size of fish, [then] the scale would be 10 per cent larger than normal throughout the life.</em>” If “average” and “normal” are considered to be expected values, then this hypothesis can be written as</p>
<p><span class="math">\[ \frac{S_{i}}{E[S|L_{i}]}=\frac{S_{C}}{E[S|L_{C}]} \]</span></p>
<p>If it is assumed that the scale-length relationship is linear, then the two expected values in these ratios are computed by plugging <span class="math">\(L_{i}\)</span> and <span class="math">\(L_{C}\)</span>, respectively, into the scale-length relationship (i.e., Equation 1) to produce</p>
<p><span class="math">\[ \frac{S_{i}}{a+bL_{i}}=\frac{S_{C}}{a+bL_{C}} \]</span></p>
<p>which can be solved for <span class="math">\(L_{i}\)</span> to yield the general SPH back-calculation model</p>
<p><span class="math">\[ L_{i} = \frac{S_{i}}{S_{C}}\left(L_{C}+\frac{a}{b}\right) - \frac{a}{b} \quad \quad \text{(5)} \]</span></p>
<p>The linear SPH model produces a family of lines that all have an intercept of <span class="math">\(-\frac{a}{b}\)</span> and pass through each observed (<span class="math">\(S_{C},L_{C}\)</span>) point (Figure 1). The SPH model is the same as the Fraser-Lee model except that the intercept from Equation 2 is replaced with <span class="math">\(-\frac{a}{b}\)</span>. Further note that the SPH model is the same as the Dahl-Lea model if <span class="math">\(a=0\)</span>.</p>
<p>The <em>body proportional hypothesis</em> (BPH) model was also named by <span class="citation">Francis (1990)</span> and was also first recognized by <span class="citation">Whitney and Carlander (1956)</span> when they said “<em>{i}f a fish at time of capture were 10 per cent smaller than the average fish with that size of scale, [then] the fish would be 10 per cent smaller than the expected length for the size of that scale throughout life.</em>” This hypothesis can be written as</p>
<p><span class="math">\[ \frac{L_{i}}{E[L|S_{i}]}=\frac{L_{C}}{E[L|S_{C}]} \]</span></p>
<p>If the length-scale relationship is linear then the expected values can be found by plugging <span class="math">\(S_{i}\)</span> and <span class="math">\(S_{c}\)</span> into Equation 2 to get</p>
<p><span class="math">\[ \frac{L_{i}}{c+dS_{i}}=\frac{L_{C}}{c+dS_{C}} \]</span></p>
<p>which can be solved for <span class="math">\(L_{i}\)</span> to yield the general BPH back-calculation model</p>
<p><span class="math">\[ L_{i}=L_{C}\frac{c+dS_{i}}{c+dS_{c}} \quad \quad \text{(6)} \]</span></p>
<p>The linear BPH model produces a family of lines that have an intercept of <span class="math">\(\frac{cL_{C}}{c+dS_{C}}\)</span> and pass through each observed (<span class="math">\(S_{C},L_{C}\)</span>) point (Figure 1). In contrast to the other back-calculation models, the BPH model uses lines with a different intercept for each fish. The linear BPH model is the same as the Dahl-Lea model if <span class="math">\(c=0\)</span>.</p>
<p><span class="citation">Vigliola and Meekan (2009)</span> described 18 other models for the back-calculation of fish length. Functions for each of these models can be created with <code>bcFuns()</code> from <code>FSA</code>.</p>

<h2>Data Organization &amp; Manipulation</h2>
<p>In <em>wide</em> or <em>one-fish-per-line</em> format, all information about a single fish, including all of the measurements from the calcified structure, is in one row of the data.frame. The <code>wb90</code> data.frame contains radial measurments in the wide format (note that the portion shown below has four rows with columns that wrapped).</p>
<pre class="r"><code>&gt; headtail(wb90,n=2)</code></pre>

<p>For the back-calculation of fish length, these data must be radial, and not incremental, measurements. If the <code>wb90</code> data.frame had contained incremental measurements, then it could be converted to radial measurements with <code>gConvert()</code> from <code>FSA</code>. The <code>gConvert()</code> function requires the data frame with the incremental measurements as the first argument, the prefix (in quotes) for the columns that contain the incremental measurements in <code>in.pre=</code>, and the type of measurement to <strong>convert to</strong> in <code>out.type=</code> (the options are <code>&quot;rad&quot;</code> (the default) or <code>&quot;inc&quot;</code>). For example, the code below would create a new data.frame from <code>wb90</code> with radial measurements (<strong>IF</strong> <code>wb90</code> had incremental measurements).</p>
<pre class="r"><code>&gt; wb90A &lt;- gConvert(wb90,in.pre=&quot;anu&quot;,out.type=&quot;rad&quot;)</code></pre>
<p>For efficient back-calculation, the data must also be converted to <em>long</em> or <em>one-measurement-per-line</em> format. As demonstrated in the <strong>IFAR</strong> book, wide data may be converted to long data with <code>gather()</code> from <code>tidyr</code>. As a reminder, the arguments to <code>gather()</code> are the wide data.frame, a name for the new variable in the long format that will identify the individual (i.e., which radial measurement), a name for the new variable in the long format that will be the value for the individual (i.e., the radial measurement), and the variables in the wide format that contain the measurements.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>&gt; wb90r &lt;- gather(wb90,agei,radi,anu1:anu9) %&gt;%
    arrange(fish,agei)
&gt; headtail(wb90r)</code></pre>
<pre><code>     yearcap fish agecap lencap  radcap agei    radi
1       1990    0      7    278 9.06803 anu1 1.50631

1628    1990  998      7    298 8.54805 anu8      NA
1629    1990  998      7    298 8.54805 anu9      NA</code></pre>
<p>As noted in the <strong>IFAR</strong> book, there are three potential problems with this result. First, the new <code>agei</code> variable contains the names of the variables from the original wide format data.frame (e.g., <code>anu1</code>, <code>anu2</code>) rather than numbers that correspond to the age that the annulus was formed. Converting these labels to numbers begins by replacing the “anu” prefix with blanks (or an empty string) using <code>str_sub()</code> with the vector of names as the first argument, <code>start=1</code> (because “anu” is a prefix) and <code>end=3</code> (because “anu” is three characters long). The result from <code>str_sub()</code>, however, is a character that must then be converted to a numeric with <code>as.numeric()</code>.</p>
<p>The second problem is that several of the radial measurements contain <code>NA</code> values. The non-<code>NA</code> values are found and retained by using <code>!is.na()</code> within <code>filterD()</code>.</p>
<p>The third problem, while not an issue with these particular data, is that “plus growth” may have been recorded. “Plus growth” is growth on the margin of the calcified structure that does not represent a complete year of growth. If “plus growth” is present, then the new <code>agei</code> variable will have a value greater than the age-at-capture value. These instances should be removed from the new long format data.frame.</p>
<p>The following code adjusts for these three issues.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>&gt; str_sub(wb90r$agei,start=1,end=3) &lt;- &quot;&quot;
&gt; wb90r %&lt;&gt;% mutate(agei=as.numeric(agei)) %&gt;%
    filterD(!is.na(radi)) %&gt;%
    filterD(agei&lt;=agecap)
&gt; headtail(wb90r)</code></pre>

<h3>Scale-Length Relationships</h3>
<p>The scale-length (Equation 1) and length-scale (Equation 2) relationships required for all but the Dahl-Lea method are computed with the wide format data. Thus, the wide format data.frame must contain the length of the fish (e.g., <code>lencap</code>) and the total radius of the calcified structure (e.g., <code>radcap</code>) at the time of capture. Both linear relationships are fit with <code>lm()</code> and the coefficients should be extracted with <code>coef()</code> and saved into objects.</p>
