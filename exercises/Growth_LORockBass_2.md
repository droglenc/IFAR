Wolfert (1980) measured the total length (TL) of 1288 Rock Bass (*Ambloplites rupestris*) from Eastern Lake Ontario in the late 1970s.  In addition, scales were removed for age estimation from as many as 10 specimens from each 10 mm length interval.  All data are recorded in `data(RockBassLO2)` from `FSAdata` [Note: the filename contains an "oh" not a "zero."].

In an [Age-Length Key exercise](ALK_LORockBass_2.html), a data.frame was produced that had age assignments for all 1288 fish.  Use that data.frame and results from [this exercise](Growth_LORockBass_1.html) to answer the questions below (i.e., open and run your script from that exercise and then continue with an analysis for the questions below.)

1. Fit the Gallucci and Quinn (1979) parameterization (see `vbModels()`).  Interpret the interval estimate for the $\omega$ parameter.

1. How does the estimate of $K$ from fitting this parameterization compare to that from the "Typical" parameterization fit in [this exercise](Growth_LORockBass_1.html).  Explain your observation.
