## Errata

* **Page 86, Footnote 7** -- "Ager C" should be "Ager B".
* **Page 207, Equation for $\hat{Z}$** -- $N$ should be $n$ in the denominator.  Thus, the new equation should be $\widehat{Z} = -log(\widehat{S}) - \frac{(n-1)(n-2)}{n(T+1)(n+T-1)} $


## Post-Production Changes

* **Section 4.2** -- I have dramatically changed the age-bias plot that is produced by supplying `plot()` with an object saved from `ageBias()`. This change is documented in [this blog post](http://derekogle.com/fishR/2017-04-26-AgeBias_inFSA) and in the [documentation](http://derekogle.com/FSA/reference/ageBias.html) and [examples](http://derekogle.com/FSA/reference/ageBias.html#examples) for `ageBias()`. The plots shown in the book can largely still be produced with `plotAB()` (see [its documentation here](http://derekogle.com/FSA/reference/plotAB.html)).
* **Section 4.4** -- I have changed the information that is returned from `agePrecision()`. All of the information shown in the book is still provided; however, other information (e.g., average standard deviation and mean absolute deviation) are now also returned. The output is document [in the documentation](http://derekogle.com/FSA/reference/agePrecision.html) for `agePrecision()`.
* **Sections 12.3.1 and 13.1** -- The dynamic plots described for finding starting values for a von Bertalanffy growth function and the stock-recruitment functions (i.e., nonlinear regressions) have been removed from `vbStarts()` and `srStarts()`, because of the difficulty of maintaining a package that requires the `tcltk` package. These functionalities are now in the `FSAsims` package, but it can also largely be replicated with the `fixed=` arguments to `vbStarts()` and `srStarts()`. Use of `fixed=` in `srStarts()` is demonstrated in [this blog post](http://derekogle.com/fishR/2017-12-12-Stock-Recruitment-Graphing-Questions#dynamic-plot-issue).
