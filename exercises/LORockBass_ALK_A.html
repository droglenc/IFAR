In addition, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fish_scale">scales</a> were removed for age estimation from as many as 10 specimens from each 10 mm length interval. All data are recorded in <strong>RockBassLO2.csv</strong> (<a href="https://github.com/droglenc/FSAdata/blob/master/data-raw/RockBassLO2.csv">view</a>, <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/droglenc/FSAdata/master/data-raw/RockBassLO2.csv">download</a>, <a href="http://derekogle.com/fishR/data/data-html/RockBassLO2.html">meta</a>). [<em>Note that the filename contains an “oh” not a “zero.”</em>].</p>
<ol>
<li>Separate the observed data into age- and length-samples. How many fish are in each sample?</li>
<li>Add a variable to the age-sample that contains the 10 mm TL categories. Construct a table of the <strong>number</strong> (not proportion) of fish in each age and 10 mm TL category in the age-sample. From these results, compute each of the following <em>by hand</em> (i.e., not using R).
<ol>
<li>How many Rock Bass in the age-sample are in the 180 mm TL category?</li>
<li>How many age-7 Rock Bass are in the age-sample?</li>
<li>What proportion of Rock Bass in the 140 mm TL category are age 4?</li>
<li>What proportion of Rock Bass in the 200 mm TL category are age 8?</li>
</ol></li>
<li>Construct an <strong>observed</strong> age-length key from the table above (using R). From these results answer the following questions.
<ol>
<li>What proportion of Rock Bass in the 210 mm TL category should be assigned age 5?</li>
<li>How many of thirty Rock Bass in the 180 mm TL category should be assigned age 5?</li>
<li>Construct a plot of the <strong>observed</strong> age-length key. Are there any potential anomalies in the plot that would suggest that a smoothed age-length key could be appropriate?</li>
</ol></li>
<li>Construct a <strong>smoothed</strong> age-length key. From these results answer the following questions.
<ol>
<li>What proportion of Rock Bass in the 210 mm length category should be assigned age 5?</li>
<li>How many of thirty Rock Bass in the 180 mm length category should be assigned age 5?</li>
</ol></li>
