<p><img style="float: right; margin: 0px 0px 10px 10px; border-radius:10px;" src="imgs/rock-bass-1.jpg" width="250px" /> <a href="https://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/1000461">Wolfert (1980)</a> measured the total length (TL) of 1288 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock_bass">Rock Bass</a> (<em>Ambloplites rupestris</em>) from Eastern <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lake_Ontario">Lake Ontario</a> in the late 1970s. In addition, scales were removed for age estimation from as many as 10 specimens from each 10 mm length interval. All data are recorded in <a href="data/RockBassLO2.csv">this CSV file</a> (these data are also available in <code>data(RockBassLO2)</code> from <code>FSAdata</code>) [Note: the filename contains an “oh” not a “zero.”].</p>
<ol>
<li>Separate the observed data into age- and length-samples. Construct an <strong>observed</strong> age-length key. [This step would have been accomplished in <a href="LORockBass_ALK_A.html">this exercise</a>.]</li>
<li>Use the semi-random age assignment technique from Isermann and Knight (2005) and the <strong>observed</strong> age-length key to assign ages to the unaged fish in the length-sample. Combine the age-sample and the age-assigned length-sample into a single data frame, add a variable to this data.frame that contains the 10 mm TL categories, and use the combined data frame to answer the following questions.
<ol>
<li>How many fish are estimated to be age 5? [Hint: use <code>xtabs()</code> or <code>Summarize()</code>.]</li>
<li>How many fish are estimated to be age 11?</li>
<li>Plot the age distribution for all fish.</li>
<li>How many fish are in the 150 mm TL interval? [Hint: use <code>xtabs()</code>.]</li>
<li>What is the mean TL of age-5 fish?</li>
<li>Plot the length-at-age with the mean length-at-age superimposed for all fish.</li>
<li>Compare your results to someone else’s results (or repeat the steps above). Did you both get the <em>exact</em> same results? Why or why not? If not, how different were they?</li>
</ol></li>
</ol>
