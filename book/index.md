## Table of Contents

1. **(Very Brief) Introduction to R Basics**
    * The most bare fundamentals of R that are required for the remainder of the book.
1. **Loading Data and Basic Manipulations**
    * Load data into R from external files and perform typical manipulations including filtering, subsetting, sorting, aggregating, joining, and converting between wide- and long-formats.
1. **Plotting Fundamentals**
    * The most bare fundamentals for constructing basic plots using base R.
1. **Age Comparisons**
    * Compare two or more estimates of ages for the same fish with precision and bias metrics and plots.
1. **Age-Length Keys**
    * Assign ages to unaged fish from their length and an age-length-key.
1. **Size Structure**
    * Assess size structure through length frequencies and the proportional size distribution metric.
1. **Weight-Length Relationships**
    * Introduction to simple linear regression through examination of weight-length relationships.
1. **Condition**
    * Compute condition metrics from observed length and weights.  Introduction to one-way ANOVA.
1. **Abundance from Capture-Recapture Data**
    * Estimate abundance from capture-recapture data for closed (single and multiple recapture events) and open populations.
1. **Abundance from Depletion Data**
    * Estimate abundance from removal or depletion samplings (Leslie, DeLury, k-pass).
1. **Mortality Rates**
    * Estimate total mortality rates from catch curve and capture-recapture data.  Estimate fishing and natural mortality with empirical models.
1. **Individual Growth**
    * Estimate parameters for the von Bertalanffy growth function and compare growth parameters among populations.
1. **Recruitment**
    * Estimate parameters for the Beverton-Holt and Ricker stock-recruitment models, compute spawning potential ratios, and estimate year-class strengths from catch data.
