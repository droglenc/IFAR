<p>Dummy variable regression (DVR) was introduced in Chapter 7 of <a href="http://derekogle.com/IFAR/"><em>Introductory Fisheries Analyses with R</em></a> in the context of determining if the slope and y-intercept parameters of weight-length relationship regressions differed between fish captured in two different years. That analysis may be extended to more than two groups, though more dummy variables are required and special methods are needed to determine which pairs of groups (if any) differ. This supplement demonstrates how to extend the DVR to more than two groups.</p>

<h3>Data Used in this Supplement</h3>
<p>Weights (g) and total lengths (mm) from Ruffe (<em>Gymnocephalus cernuus</em>) captured in the St. Louis River Harbor (Minnesota and Wisconsin) were used in Chapter 7 and will also be used in this supplement. These data are from <span class="citation">Ogle and Winfield (2009)</span> and are in <code>RuffeSLRH.csv</code>. To eliminate within-season variability, only Ruffe captured in July are used here. Additionally, a factored version of <code>year</code> was created, the common logarithms of weight and length were created, and the <code>fishID</code>, <code>month</code>, and <code>day</code> variables were removed to save space in the output.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>&gt; ruf &lt;- read.csv(&quot;RuffeSLRH.csv&quot;) %&gt;%

<p>For the first example below, only fish from 1990, 1995, and 2000 were examined. In the second example below, fish from 1992 to 1995 were examined.</p>

<h2>Full Model</h2>
<p>The number of dummy variables required to represent <span class="math">\(k\)</span> groups is <span class="math">\(k-1\)</span>. Thus, in Chapter 7, only one dummy variable was required to represent the two groups. In this example, three groups (the years) are being examined and, thus, two dummy variables are needed. For example, <code>lm()</code> will ultimately treat the “1990” group as the reference group and create two dummy variables as follows</p>
<p> </p>
<p><span class="math">\[  fYear1995 = \left\{\begin{array}{l}
    1 \text{, if captured in 1995 }\\
    0 \text{, if NOT captured in 1995 }
    \end{array}  \right. \]</span></p>
<p><span class="math">\[  fYear2000 = \left\{\begin{array}{l}
    1 \text{, if captured in 2000 }\\
    0 \text{, if NOT captured in 2000 }
    \end{array}  \right. \]</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p>These dummy variables are each combined with the <span class="math">\(log_{10}(L)\)</span> covariate to construct the following ultimate full model</p>
<p> </p>
<p><span class="math">\[ \begin{split}
    log_{10}(W_{i}) &amp;= log_{10}(\alpha) + \beta log_{10}(L_{i}) \\
                    &amp;\mspace{16mu}+ \delta_{1} fYear1995 + \delta_{2} fYear2000 \\
                    &amp;\mspace{16mu}+ \gamma_{1} fYear1995*log_{10}(L_{i})+ \gamma_{2} fYear2000*log_{10}(L_{i}) + \epsilon_{i}\quad \quad \quad \quad \text{(1)}
\end{split} \]</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Substitution of appropriate values for the dummy variables into Equation 1 shows how Equation 1 simultaneously represents the weight-length relationship regressions for all three years (Table 1). From these submodels, it is apparent that <span class="math">\(\alpha\)</span> is the y-intercept for the reference (e.g., 1990) group, <span class="math">\(\beta\)</span> is the slope for the reference group, <span class="math">\(\delta_{i}\)</span> is the difference in y-intercepts between the <span class="math">\(i\)</span>th and reference groups, and <span class="math">\(\gamma_{i}\)</span> is the difference in slopes between the <span class="math">\(i\)</span>th and reference groups. By extension, the interaction variables measure differences in slopes and the dummy variables measure differences in y-intercepts.</p>

<p>From these results it is apparent that the interaction term is a significant predictor in the model. In relation to Equation 1 this suggests that at least one of <span class="math">\(\gamma_{1}\)</span> or <span class="math">\(\gamma_{2}\)</span> is significantly different than zero, which implies that the slope of the relationship for fish captured in 1995, 2000, or both differs significantly from the slope for fish captured in 1990. Additionally, it is possible that the slopes for fish captured in 1995 and 2000 also differ, but this cannot be assessed with this model.</p>
<p>The ANOVA table for the fit of the full model is useful for determining if there is some difference in the regression model parameters among groups, but it cannot specifically identify where those differences occur. Specific differences are identified in the next section.</p>

<h2>Pinpointing Specific Differences Among Slopes</h2>
<p>No simple method exists (such as Tukey’s Honestly Significant Difference (HSD) method) for comparing slopes among all pairs of groups while controlling for an increase in experimentwise error due to multiple comparisons. One strategy to perform these tests, though, is to fit the DVR as in the previous section and extract all of the p-values for comparisons of slopes to the reference level. Another model is then fit where the reference level has been changed and all p-values for comparisons of slopes to this level are extracted. This process is repeated until p-values for all pairwise comparisons has been extracted. The set of p-values from these comparisons is then submitted to procedures, such as one of the sequential Bonferroni or false discovery rate procedures, that are designed to adjust a set of p-values for multiple comparisons.</p>
<p>Controlling the experimentwise error rate for multiple comparisons is easily accomplished in R with <code>p.adjust()</code>. However, the sequential resetting of the reference level, fitting a new model, and extracting the p-values from all slope comparisons is tedious, especially for many groups. Fortunately, <code>compSlopes()</code> from <code>FSA</code> automates the tedious computation of the set of p-values and use of <code>p.adjust()</code> to control the experimentwise error rate.</p>
<p>The <code>compSlopes()</code> function requires a DVR model fit with <code>lm()</code> as its first argument. The method to control for multiple comparisons may be set with <code>method=</code> and may be any of the methods returned by <code>p.adjust.methods()</code> (see <code>?p.adjust</code>).</p>

<div id="pinpointing-specific-differences-among-intercepts" class="section level2">
<h2>Pinpointing Specific Differences Among Intercepts</h2>
<p>When a difference in slopes exists, as in the previous example, it generally does not make sense to compare intercepts. However, if the slopes do not differ, then testing for differences in intercepts becomes important because, with parallel lines (i.e., same slopes), a difference in intercepts implies that the mean value of the response variable differs at <em>every</em> value of the explanatory variable.</p>
<p>The example below fits a DVR of the weight-length relationship regressions for the years from 1992 to 1995 (data.frame constructed above). In this example, the interaction term is not a significant predictor which indicates that none of the slopes differ. However, the term related to the factor variable is significant, which implies that at least one of the <span class="math">\(\delta_{i}\)</span> is different from zero. Thus, the y-intercept for at least of 1993, 1994, or 1995 differs from the y-intercept for 1992 (the reference level).</p>

<p>The same problem of incomplete comparisons and increasing experimentwise error occurs here with the y-intercepts as occurred with the slopes above. The solution, however, is different here because the y-intercept is a point estimate, whereas the slope estimates a rate of change. In this case, Tukey’s HSD method can be used to determine which pairs of y-intercepts differ. However, the observed values need to be adjusted to a single values of the covariate.</p>
<p>The adjusted value for an individual is computed by adding the individual’s residual to the predicted value of the response variable at a common covariate value based on the regression line for that individual. Visually, this adjustment may be thought of as sliding each point along its corresponding regression line to a common value along the x-axis.</p>
<p>The <code>compIntercepts()</code> function from <code>FSA</code> performs these adjustments and applies Tukey’s HSD procedure to the adjusted values. The <code>compIntercepts()</code> function requires the fitted DVR as the first argument. By default, the response variables are are adjusted to the mean value of the covariate unless a value is given to <code>common.cov=</code>. For example, the actual y-intercepts will be used if <code>common.cov=0</code>. Also note that a warning is given if the DVR model contains an interaction term, though <code>compIntercepts()</code> will adjust for this by fitting a new model without the nonsignificant interaction term.</p>
