Researchers for the [North Temperate Lakes Long-Term Ecological Research](https://lter.limnology.wisc.edu/) program have collected fish from a number of lakes in Wisconsin since 1981.  The total lengths and weights of [Yellow Perch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yellow_perch) (*Perca flavescens*) captured from [Trout Lake](https://lter.limnology.wisc.edu/researchsite/trout-lake) from 1981-2006 are recorded in `r addDataLinks("YPerchTL")`.  Use these data to answer the following questions.  [*Note that these data came from [this website](https://lter.limnology.wisc.edu/dataset/north-temperate-lakes-lter-fish-lengths-and-weights-1981-current).  See the site for more information about the sampling protocol that produced these data.*]

Complete [this Data Manipulation exercise](YPTroutLake_DataManip.html) to create the required data.frames used in the following questions.

1. Describe the distribution of lengths for Yellow Perch captured in fyke nets in 2005 using both a histogram and frequency table with 10 mm length categories.

1. Statistically compare the length frequency distributions between Yellow Perch captured with a beach seine and in fyke nets in 1998.

1. Use the data.frame for Yellow Perch captured in 1998 (from all gears combined).
    1. Compute the $PSD-Q$ value (with 95% confidence interval).
    1. Compute the $PSD-P$ value (with 95% confidence interval).
    1. What assumption must be made for these calculations to have a useful biological meaning.
