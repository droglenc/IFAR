<p><img style="float: right; margin: 0px 0px 10px 10px; border-radius:10px;" src="imgs/drum-1.jpg" width="250px" /> <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0380133084718065">Bur (1984)</a> examined the population dynamics of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freshwater_drum">Freshwater Drum</a> (<em>Aplodinotus grunniens</em>) in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lake_Erie">Lake Erie</a> in the late 1970s. In one part of his study, he measured the total length (TL) of all 1577 drum sampled and extracted <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fish_scale">scales</a> for age estimation from a proportionate sample from each 10 mm length interval. The length and age data are recorded in <strong>FWDrumLE2.csv</strong> (<a href="https://github.com/droglenc/FSAdata/blob/master/data-raw/FWDrumLE2.csv">view</a>, <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/droglenc/FSAdata/master/data-raw/FWDrumLE2.csv">download</a>, <a href="http://derekogle.com/fishR/data/data-html/FWDrumLE2.html">meta</a>).</p>
<ol>
<li>Separate the observed data into age- and length-samples. How many fish are in each sample?</li>
<li>Add a variable to the age-sample that contains the 10 mm TL categories. Construct a table of the <strong>number</strong> (not proportion) of fish in each age and 10 mm TL category in the age-sample. From these results, compute each of the following <em>by hand</em> (i.e., not using R).
<ol>
<li>How many Freshwater Drum in the age-sample are in the 230 mm TL category?</li>
<li>How many age-5 Freshwater Drum are in the age-sample?</li>
<li>What proportion of Freshwater Drum in the 300 mm TL category are age 5?</li>
<li>What proportion of Freshwater Drum in the 200 mm TL category are age 4?</li>
</ol></li>
<li>Construct an <strong>observed</strong> age-length key from the table above (using R). From these results answer the following questions.
<ol>
<li>What proportion of Freshwater Drum in the 210 mm TL category should be assigned age 5?</li>
<li>How many of thirty Rock Bass in the 250 mm TL category should be assigned age 4?</li>
<li>Construct a plot of the <strong>observed</strong> age-length key. Are there any potential anomalies in the plot that would suggest that a smoothed age-length key could be appropriate?</li>
</ol></li>
<li>Construct a <strong>smoothed</strong> age-length key. From these results answer the following questions.
<ol>
<li>What proportion of Freshwater Drum in the 210 mm TL category should be assigned age 5?</li>
<li>How many of thirty Rock Bass in the 250 mm TL category should be assigned age 4?</li>
</ol></li>
