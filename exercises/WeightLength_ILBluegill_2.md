title: Weight-Length
subtitle: Inch Lake Bluegill II
---

The total lengths (inches) and weights (g) for subsamples of several species of fish collected from Inch Lake (Wisconsin) in May of 2007 and 2008 are recorded in `InchLake2` in `FSAdata`.  Load these data, isolate Bluegill (*Lepomis macrochirus*), and answer the following questions.  [Note that this is a continuation of [this exercise](WeightLength_ILBluegill_1.html).]

1. Plot the transformed weight-length data using different symbols or colors for the two years of samples.  Qualitatively assess if the weight-length relationship differs between the two years.
1. Determine if there is a statistically signficant difference in the weight-length relationship between the two years.  Provide evidence for your findings and carefully interpret the final result.
1. Using the results from above (and without fitting separate regressions for the two sample years) express the weight-length relationships on the raw scale for both years.
1. Construct a plot that illustrates your findings.

Continue with this data set for this [condition](Condition_ILBluegill.html) exercise.
