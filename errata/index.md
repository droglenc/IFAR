* *Page xvi* -- Note that all code found in the book still produces the same results using version 0.8.4 of `FSA`.

* *Page 123* -- `$ks$p.value` in the first full paragraph returns the p-value from the overall Kolmogorov-Smirnov test.  Appending `$ks.boot.pvalue` to the `ks.boot()` object will return the bootstrapped p-value.

* *Page 295* -- The McBride (2015) reference has now been assigned to a volume with page numbers.  Thus, the end of that citation should include **ICES Journal of Marine Science** 72:2149-2167.
