[Herbst and Marsden (2011)](http://www.uvm.edu/rsenr/emarsden/documents/Herbst%20and%20Marsden%20whitefish%20age%20structure%20comparison.pdf) compared the precision, bias, and reader uncertainty of ages estimated from the [scales](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fish_scale), dorsal fin rays, and [otoliths](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Otolith) of 151 [Lake Whitefish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lake_whitefish) (*Coregonus clupeaformis*) captured from [Lake Champlain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lake_Champlain) in 2009.  The inital age estimates from two readers and a consensus age between the two readers from each of the three structures (variables are the structure name with a "1" or "2" appended to denote the reader or "C" for the consensus age) are in `r addDataLinks("WhitefishLC")`.

1. Use tabular, graphical, and statistical methods to describe any apparent bias between the *consensus* age estimates from scales and otoliths.
1. Describe any apparent bias in age estimates from otoliths between the two readers.
1. Describe precision in age estimates between the two readers for otoliths.
1. Describe any apparent bias in age estimates from scales between the two readers.
1. Describe precision in age estimates between the two readers for scales.
1. Describe any apparent bias in *consensus* age estimates from fin rays and otoliths.
1. Describe any apparent bias in age estimates from fin rays between the two readers.
1. Describe precision in age estimates between the two readers for from fin rays.
