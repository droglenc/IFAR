title: Weight-Length
subtitle: Inch Lake Bluegill
---

The total lengths (inches) and weights (g) for subsamples of several species of fish collected from Inch Lake (Wisconsin) in May of 2007 and 2008 are recorded in `InchLake2` in `FSAdata`.  Load these data, isolate Bluegill (*Lepomis macrochirus*), and answer the following questions.

1. Plot the raw weight-length data.  Describe key characteristics of this plot.
1. Appropriately transform and plot the data.  Describe key characteristics of this plot.
1. Compute the weight-length relationship and express your results as an equation on both the transformed and raw scales.
1. Show the results of the weight-length relationship as plots on both the transformed and raw scales.
1. Carefully interpret the meaning of the slope of the weight-length relationship.
1. Is there statistical evidence for isometric or allometric growth?
1. Convert the total length measurements to metric units and recompute the weight-length relationship.  How do the slope and y-intercepts from this model fitting compare to your results from above?

Continue with this data set for [weight-length comparisons](WeightLength_ILBluegill_2.html) and [condition](Condition_ILBluegill.html) exercises.
