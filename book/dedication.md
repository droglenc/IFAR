## Dedication

I have been fortunate enough to have had three significant mentors during my career.

* **Nicholas Bystrom** was [my basketball coach](http://www.northlandcollegesports.com/hof.aspx?hof=48&path=&kiosk=) and statistics and mathematics professor at [Northland College](http://www.northland.edu/).  "Coach" helped me understand, very early in my career, the power, utility, and beauty of mathematics and statistics.
* **James Selgeby** was my boss for a work-study position with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service during my last two years at [Northland College](http://www.northland.edu/).  Jim trusted me as a fisheries scientist, fostered my passion for Great Lakes fisheries, and encouraged me to pursue an advanced degree in fisheries.
* **George Spangler** was my doctoral advisor at the University of Minnesota.  George strongly encouraged advanced studies in statistics, supported my interest in programming, and provided an environment, as a graduate student and later while on sabbatical, where I could creatively mix statistics, programming, and fisheries.

This book would not exist without each of these great men.  I dedicate this work to them.
