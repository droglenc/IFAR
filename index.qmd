*Introductory Fisheries Analyses with R* by [Derek H. Ogle](https://derekogle.com/) provides detailed instructions on how to perform basic fisheries stock assessment analyses in the R environment. The analyses covered are typical analyses for many working fisheries scientists and, thus, also occur in most upper-level undergraduate and graduate level fisheries science, analysis, or management courses. The book begins with three foundational chapters that help the reader become familiar with R within the context of basic fisheries analyses and examples. The remaining chapters build upon these foundational skills with analytical techniques specific to fisheries stock assessments. Available from [Routledge](https://www.routledge.com/Introductory-Fisheries-Analyses-with-R/Ogle/p/book/9781482235203).

The book is [dedicated to my three professional mentors.](dedication.qmd)
